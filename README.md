Testing the matlab CI Action

This repository has two branches: [a branch with a passing unit test](https://github.com/ilent2/matlabci-test/tree/passing)
and [a branch with a failing unit test](https://github.com/ilent2/matlabci-test/tree/failing).
The purpose is to test the Matlab unit test Action on GitHub.

I've documented my process on (LINK).
